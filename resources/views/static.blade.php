<h2>USER PRIVACY STATEMENT OR PRIVACY POLICY</h3>

<p>Effective Date: July 1st, 2018</p>
<p>ExpressDrive collects information about you when you use our mobile applications, websites, and other online products and services (collectively, the “Services”) and through other interactions and communications, you have with us. If you reside in Ghana, the Services are provided by ExpressDrive Limited and its Ghanaian affiliates (collectively expressive), and this Privacy Statement applies to information collected and used by ExpressDrive.</p>
<h2>Scope and Application</h2>
<p>This Privacy Statement (“Statement") applies to persons anywhere in the world who use our apps or Services to request transportation, delivery, or other on-demand services (“Users”). This Statement does not apply to information we collect from or about drivers, couriers, partner transportation companies, or any other persons who use the ExpressDrive platform under license (collectively “Drivers”). If you interact with the Services as both a User and a Driver, the respective privacy statements apply to your different interactions.</p>
<h2>COLLECTION OF INFORMATION</h2>
<p>Information you provide to us</p>
<p>We collect information you provide directly to us, such as when you create or modify your account, request on-demand services, contact customer support, or otherwise communicate with us. This information may include: name, email, phone number, postal address, profile picture, payment method, items requested (for delivery services), delivery notes, and other information you choose to provide.</p>
<h2>Information we collect through your use of our Services</h2>
<p>
When you use our Services, we collect information about you in the following general categories:</p>
<h2>Location Information:</h2>
<p>When you use the services for transportation or delivery, we collect precise location data about the trip from the ExpressDrive app used by the Drivers and Riders. If you permit the ExpressDrive apps to access location services through the permission system used by your mobile operating system (“platform”), we may also collect the precise location of your device when the app is running in the foreground or background. We may also derive your approximate location from your IP address.</p>

<h2>Contacts Information:</h2>
<p>If you permit the ExpressDrive apps to access the address book on your device through the permission system used by your mobile platform, we may access and store names and contact information from your address book to facilitate social interactions through our Services and for other purposes described in this Statement or at the time of consent or collection.</p>
<h2>Transaction Information:</h2>
<p>We collect transaction details related to your use of our Services, including the type of service requested, date and time the service was provided, amount charged, distance traveled, and other related transaction details. Additionally, if someone uses your promo code, we may associate your name with that person.</p>
<h2>Usage and Preference Information:</h2> <p>We collect information about how you and site visitors interact with our Services, preferences expressed, and settings chosen. In some cases we do this through the use of cookies, pixel tags, and similar technologies that create and maintain unique identifiers.</p>
<h2>Device Information:</h2><p>We may collect information about your mobile device, including, for example, the hardware model, operating system and version, software and file names and versions, preferred language, unique device identifier, advertising identifiers, serial number, device motion information, and mobile network information.</p>
<h2>Call and SMS Data:</h2><p>Our Services facilitate communications between Users and Drivers. In connection with facilitating this service, we receive call data, including the date and time of the call or SMS message, the parties phone numbers, and the content of the SMS message.</p>
<h2>Log Information:</h2><p>When you interact with the Services, we collect server logs, which may include information like device IP address, access dates and times, app features or pages viewed, app crashes and other system activity, type of browser, and the third-party site or service you were using before interacting with our Services.</p> 
<h2>IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT PLATFORM PERMISSIONS</h2>
<p>Most mobile platforms (iOS, Android, etc.) have defined certain types of device data that apps cannot access without your consent. And these platforms have different permission systems for obtaining your consent. The iOS platform will alert you the first time the ExpressDrive app wants permission to access certain types of data and will let you consent (or not consent) to that request. Android devices will notify you of the permissions that the ExpressDrive app seeks before you first use the app, and your use of the app constitutes your consent.
</p>
<h2>INFORMATION WE COLLECT FROM OTHER SOURCES</h2>
<p>We may also receive information from other sources and combine that with information we collect through our Services. For example:
If you choose to link, create, or log in to your ExpressDrive account with a payment provider (e.g., Google Wallet, Stripe etc) website that uses our API (or whose API we use), we may receive information about you or your connections from that site or app.
When you request on demand services, our Drivers may provide us with a User rating after providing services to you.
If you also interact with our Services in another capacity, for instance as a Driver or user of other apps we provide, we may combine or associate that information with information we have collected from you in your capacity as a User or rider.
</p>

<h2>USE OF INFORMATION</h2>
<p>
We may use the information we collect about you to:
Provide, maintain, and improve our Services, including, for example, to facilitate payments, send receipts, provide products and services you request (and send related information), develop new features, provide customer support to Users and Drivers, develop safety features, authenticate users, and send product updates and administrative messages;
Perform internal operations, including, for example, to prevent fraud and abuse of our Services; to troubleshoot software bugs and operational problems; to conduct data analysis, testing, and research; and to monitor and analyze usage and activity trends;

Where this is the case, we will take appropriate measures to protect your personal information in accordance with this Statement.

<h2>YOUR CHOICES</h2>
<h2>Account Information</h2>

If you wish to cancel your account, please email us at <a href="mailto:support@expressdrivegh.com">support@expressdrivegh.com</a>. Please note that in some cases we may retain certain information about you as required by law, or for legitimate business purposes to the extent permitted by law.

</p>
<h2>Access Rights</h2>
<p>ExpressDrive will comply with individual’s requests regarding access, correction, and/or deletion of the personal data it stores in accordance with applicable law.
</p>
<h2>Location Information</h2>
<p>We request permission for our app’s collection of precise location from your device per the permission system used by your mobile operating system. If you initially permit the collection of this information, you can later disable it by changing the location settings on your mobile device. However, this will limit your ability to use certain features of our Services. Additionally, disabling our Apps collection of precise location from your device will not limit our ability to collect your trip location information from a Driver's device nor our ability to derive approximate location from your IP address.
</p>
<h2>Contact Information</h2>
<p>We may also seek permission for our Apps collection and syncing of contact information from your device per the permission system used by your mobile operating system.

The Android platform does not provide such a setting.

<p>We may change this Statement from time to time. If we make significant changes in the way we treat your personal information, or to the Statement, we will provide you notice through the Services or by some other means, such as email. Your continued use of the Services after such notice constitutes your consent to the changes. We encourage you to periodically review the Statement for the latest information on our privacy practices.
</p>
<h2>Security</h2>
